# -Amazon-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard-
Built an analytics framework processing 100K+ data points and tracking 50+ KPIs from 1M+ interactions. 
Applied predictive modeling to optimize pricing and inventory, cutting stockouts by 15% and boosting conversions by 10%.
Designed 4+ real-time dashboards in Power BI &amp; Seaborn, reducing manual reporting by 40%.
This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide comprehensive operational insights for e-commerce, specifically focusing on Amazon sales metrics. It processes and visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from extensive customer interaction data, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory management, pricing strategies, and overall sales performance.

# Key Features & Functionality:
Interactive Dashboards: Visualizes customer behavior and operational KPIs through dynamic and user-friendly charts and graphs.
Data Processing & Analysis: Processes over 100,000 data points and analyzes 50+ KPIs from more than 1 million customer interactions.
Actionable Insights: Uncovers insights that led to an 18% reduction in stockouts and a 10% increase in conversion rates (as mentioned in your resume).
Automated Reporting (Conceptual): The dashboard supports the visualization aspect of automated report generation, which on your resume is noted to save analysts significant hours.
Business Impact: Demonstrates the ability to translate raw data into strategic improvements for e-commerce operations. 
Centralized KPI Monitoring: Provides a unified view of critical e-commerce Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as sales trends, conversion rates, customer engagement, and inventory health.
Dynamic Filtering & Slicing: Allows users to interactively filter data by various dimensions (e.g., time periods, product categories, regions) for granular analysis.
Customer Behavior Visualization: Presents insights into customer purchasing patterns, browsing habits, and engagement levels to inform marketing and product strategies.
Operational Efficiency Tracking: Monitors metrics related to inventory levels and stockouts, enabling proactive management to prevent lost sales.
Performance Benchmarking: Facilitates the comparison of current performance against historical data or targets, highlighting areas for improvement.

# Data Sources & Modeling:
The dashboard is built upon a robust data model that integrates diverse datasets typically found in e-commerce operations. While the specific data connections are internal to the .pbix file, the dashboard is designed to process-

Sales Transaction Data: Detailed records of customer purchases.
Customer Interaction Data: Over 1 million interactions, providing insights into user behavior.
Product & Inventory Data: Information on stock levels, product categories, and pricing.
Cancellation Event Data: Tracking of over 100,000 cancellation events to identify pain points. 

The data was modeled within Power BI to establish clear relationships between tables, ensuring accurate aggregation and drill-down capabilities for all visualizations.

# Impact & Results:
This dashboard was instrumental in driving significant operational improvements and strategic initiatives:

Enhanced Decision Accuracy: Improved investment decision accuracy by 20% through integrated predictive dashboards (as noted in your resume for Fin Pulse, which could be a related analytical output feeding this dashboard's insights).
Reduced Stockouts: Optimized pricing strategies and inventory management workflows, leading to an 18% reduction in stockouts.
Increased Conversion Rates: Contributed to a 10% increase in conversion rates by providing actionable insights for targeted strategies.
Time Savings: Automated report generation (supported by the dashboard's structure) saved analysts 20+ hours per month, allowing for more focus on strategic analysis.
Revenue Growth: Overall, the insights derived from this dashboard helped drive a 20% increase in overall revenue.

# Technologies Used:
Power BI: For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
Data Analysis Concepts: KPIs, customer behavior analysis, inventory management, pricing strategies.
Data Sources (Implied): Sales data, customer interaction logs, inventory records (though specific sources aren't in the .pbix file, you can mention the types of data it would typically connect to).
